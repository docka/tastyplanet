The service is a Hyper Island Student Project, created by Digital Data Strategist '14 students Kelly Brofall, Dave Garfinkel & Anders Lundkvist, during Toolbox module. 

The project was possible through the aid of the following technologies:<br>
Code available on Github<br>
Responsive design through Bootstrap<br> 
Locations shared on Google Maps<br>
Accounts stored on Firebase<br>
Embedded feed from Instagram<br>
Fonts called from Google Fonts<br>
...and more...<br>
